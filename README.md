## Pymunk

This contains a 2D simulation, using the Chipmunk engine with the Pymunk wrapper.

## Pybullet

This contains a 3D simulation using the Bullet physics engine, with the Pybullet wrapper. 

The oop-refactor branch has the best version of this code, however it does not have volume fraction calculations working yet.
